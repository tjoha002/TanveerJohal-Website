        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Tanveer Johal and I am currently a student at University of California Riverside. I am finishing up my senior year and am currently trying to enroll in jobs. I am studying mechanical engineering and am trying finish up my degree as fast as I can. I was born and raised in Sacramento, CA. I did all my schooling out in Sacramento up until college. For college I moved down south to Riverside. I am a hardworking person who works well with others. I am respectful and like to have fun while getting my work done. One of my favorite things to do is playing basketball. I have been playing basketball since I was a little kid and enjoy playing till this day. On my free time I enjoy spending time wth my family and friends. I have a dog who I got recently. It had always been a dream of mine to own a dog and now I am happy that I can experience this. I am someone who enjoys solving problems and helping others. <br><br>

        I am someone who thrives in brainstorming sessions, bouncing ideas off teammates and refining them into groundbreaking solutions. I you see myself leading a design team, tackling complex challenges and bringing innovative products to life. My drive to create new inventions suggests a natural curiosity and an openness to exploring uncharted territory, qualities that are invaluable in any engineering field. I chose to be an engineer because of my passion to help others. I like to work with parts hands on and am a better learner in that sense. I am inspired by companies such as amazon and tesla and want to have a company as successful as such.<br><br>

        My passion for engineering rooted from when I was a young kid. Growing up I had always been interested in engineering and trying to figure out why things work the way that they do. This interest allowed me to pursue my dreams of wanting to be and engineer. While choosing which type of engineer to be I looked at a variety of different options. Mechanical engineering was something that encompasses a little bit of every type of engineering. This wide variety of flexibility peekde my interest. I do not know exactly what I want to do with this degree just yet. My college experience has been tough. Throughout my classes I hoped to find out in which path I want to go down. However I am still in my last year of college. After college I hope to find a job that makes alot of money. Engineer majors make alot of money, which is one of the reasons why I chose it. I also hope to get a job that I enjoy and am able to stay in for a long time. For me it is important to be in a job that i enjoy doing and have fun in. I hope to have coworkers who are fun to work with and are hardworking.
